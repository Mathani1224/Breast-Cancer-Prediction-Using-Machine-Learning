The Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning project aims to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on key medical features. Using data preprocessing, feature selection, and machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, the model ensures accurate diagnosis. This system helps in early detection and risk assessment, assisting medical professionals in making informed decisions for better patient care.
